Stable Release:
* Features basic automata simulation using moore neighborhoods, pausing,
restarting, toroidal boards, and customizable rules.

Feature Expansion:
* Each update adds features to make the program more flexible.
* There will also be updates to improve the user interface, the program's
performance, and the clarity of the code.

Ideas:
* Directional automata: each cell has both a value and a direction.
* Runtime-modifiable rules.
* Different kinds of seeding patterns.
* Outsourceable rulesets, e.g. using config files.

Version Plans:

    v1.1 - Gearing up for new development.
================================================================================
* Basic user interface and code clarity changes to prepare for new features.
    -> Separate modules into more granular pieces.
    -> Cleaner point of entry with less global constants.
* Removal of heavy reliance on constants file for parameters.
* Possible changes in function design to be more flexible.

* Rules to be changed at runtime, while paused?

    v1.2 - Performance-enhancing libraries?
================================================================================
* Switch to OpenGL for the rendering backend.
* Offload some of the simulation to the graphics card.

    v1.3 - First major new features?
================================================================================
* Add direction parameters to each cell to be used arbitrarily.

    v1.4 - Ease of use and configuration?
================================================================================
* Offload configuration to a config file, likely using either lua or yml.
